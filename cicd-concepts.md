# CI/CD Concepts

## What is CI
Continuous Integration means automatically building and checking
code whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

## What is CD
Continuous Deployment means automatically deploying the application
after CI steps succeed.

## Why CI/CD is important
CI/CD reduces manual work, prevents deployment mistakes, and allows
faster and more reliable releases.

## How I used CI/CD in my project
In my project, CI/CD is implemented using GitHub Actions. When I push
code, it automatically builds a Docker image and deploys it to AWS EC2.
