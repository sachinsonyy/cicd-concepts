# Logs and Monitoring in CI/CD

## GitHub Actions Logs
Used to debug pipeline-level issues such as build or deployment failures.

## Docker Logs
Used to debug application behavior inside containers.

## EC2/Linux Logs
Used to debug system-level issues like service failures.

## Debugging Approach
I first check CI/CD logs, then container logs, and finally system logs.
