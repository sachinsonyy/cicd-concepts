# Secrets and Security in CI/CD

## What are secrets
Secrets are sensitive values like SSH keys or server IPs
that should not be stored in code repositories.

## GitHub Secrets
GitHub Secrets store sensitive data securely and inject them
into workflows during runtime.

## SSH in CI/CD
SSH is used by the CI/CD pipeline to connect securely to the
EC2 server and execute deployment commands.

## Why SSH keys are used
SSH keys are more secure than passwords and suitable for
automated deployments.
