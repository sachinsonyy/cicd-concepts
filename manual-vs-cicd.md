# Manual vs CI/CD Deployment

## Manual Deployment
Manual deployment involves connecting to servers and running
deployment commands by hand.

### Pros
- Simple
- Useful for learning and quick fixes

### Cons
- Error-prone
- Not scalable
- Depends on human steps

## CI/CD Deployment
CI/CD deployment automates the build and deployment process
on every code change.

### Pros
- Reliable
- Repeatable
- Faster deployments
- Suitable for teams

### Cons
- Requires initial setup
- Needs secure configuration

## My Project Approach
I first deployed manually to understand the process and then
used CI/CD to automate and standardize deployments.
