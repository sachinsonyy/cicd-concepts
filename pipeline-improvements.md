# CI/CD Pipeline Improvements

## Clear step naming
Improved step names to make the pipeline easier to understand and debug.

## Separation of concerns
Organized steps into build and deploy phases for better readability.

## Failure safety
Used conditional commands to prevent deployment failure if containers
do not already exist.

## Maintainability
Improved pipeline structure so future changes are easier.
